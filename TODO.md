# Dog Breed Classifier - Project TODOs

## Current Status

âœ… Basic IMAGEWOOF classifier built (93.7% accuracy)
âœ… Transfer learning with ResNet34 working
âœ… Understanding of freeze/unfreeze and fine-tuning

---

## ðŸ“Š Phase 1: Complete the Analysis (Chapter 1 Concepts)

### High Priority - Finish Core Learning

- [ ] **Confusion Matrix** - See which breeds get confused with each other
  - `interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn)`
  - `interp.plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(12,12))`
  - Shows patterns: Do terriers get confused? Samoyed vs Old English Sheepdog?

- [ ] **Top Losses Analysis** - Look at worst predictions
  - `interp.plot_top_losses(9, nrows=3)`
  - Understand WHY the model fails
  - Are images blurry? Weird angles? Actually mislabeled?

- [ ] **Document Findings** - Add markdown cells explaining:
  - Which breeds are hardest to classify?
  - What do the errors have in common?
  - How could the model be improved?

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Phase 2: Make It Interactive & Visual

### Medium Priority - Showcase Features

- [ ] **Single Image Prediction Function**
  - Upload/point to any dog image
  - Show top 3 predictions with confidence scores
  - Display the image with predictions overlaid

- [ ] **Prediction Visualization**
  - Bar chart of probabilities for all 10 breeds
  - Shows confidence visually

- [ ] **Sample Gallery**
  - Show 20 random correct predictions
  - Show 10 interesting mistakes
  - Makes the notebook visually impressive

---

## ðŸš€ Phase 3: Simple Production-Ready Features

### Medium Priority - Real-World Application

- [ ] **Export the Model**
  - `learn.export('dog_breed_model.pkl')`
  - Model can be loaded without training code
  - First step toward deployment

- [ ] **Create Inference Function**
  - Clean function that takes image path â†’ returns breed + confidence
  - Can be used in external scripts
  - Example: `predict_breed('my_dog.jpg')` â†’ `('Golden Retriever', 0.94)`

- [ ] **Test with Real Images**
  - Download 5-10 dog images from the internet (not in IMAGEWOOF)
  - Test if model generalizes to real-world photos
  - Document successes and failures

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - What happens with non-dog images?
  - What about dogs not in the 10 breeds?
  - Add uncertainty threshold ("Not confident enough")

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 4: Make It Portfolio-Worthy

### Lower Priority - Polish

- [ ] **README for the notebook**
  - Clear explanation of the project
  - Results summary (accuracy, confusion matrix insights)
  - How to run it
  - Future improvements

- [ ] **Performance Comparison**
  - Try ResNet18 vs ResNet34 vs ResNet50
  - Document speed vs accuracy tradeoffs
  - Shows understanding of model selection

- [ ] **Data Augmentation Experiments**
  - Compare results with/without augmentation
  - Show example augmented images
  - Document impact on accuracy

---

## ðŸŒŸ Phase 5: Simple Web Demo (If Ambitious)

### Stretch Goals - Production App

- [ ] **Gradio Interface** (Easiest web demo)
  - Upload image â†’ Get breed prediction
  - 10-20 lines of code with Gradio
  - Can be hosted on Hugging Face Spaces (free!)

- [ ] **Streamlit App** (Alternative to Gradio)
  - Slightly more control over UI
  - Also easy to deploy

- [ ] **Example Code Structure:**

  ```python
  import gradio as gr
  from fastai.vision.all import *

  learn = load_learner('dog_breed_model.pkl')

  def classify_dog(img):
      pred, pred_idx, probs = learn.predict(img)
      return {learn.dls.vocab[i]: float(probs[i]) for i in range(len(probs))}

  gr.Interface(fn=classify_dog,
               inputs=gr.Image(),
               outputs=gr.Label(num_top_classes=3)).launch()
  ```

## ðŸ“š Recommended Order for Tomorrow

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Complete the Chapter 1 concepts (confusion matrix, top losses)
2. **Add Phase 2** - Make it visually impressive
3. **Phase 3** - Export model and test on real images
4. **If time** - Add Gradio demo (super easy, huge impact)

---

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Goals

Each phase teaches something:

- **Phase 1**: Model evaluation and interpretation
- **Phase 2**: Presentation and communication
- **Phase 3**: Production ML basics (export, inference, error handling)
- **Phase 4**: Experimentation and documentation
- **Phase 5**: Deployment and user interaction

## Notes

- Keep it in the notebook for now (portable, shows work)
- Can extract to separate scripts later if needed
- Focus on understanding over complexity
- Each addition should teach you something new

**Next session**: Start with confusion matrix and top losses - these are fascinating and will give you insights into your model!
